Find Me!
--------

Find me! is a web-service that allows for people w/ modern smarthphones to easily find each other using Google Maps, geo-tracking and a persistent server.

The interface is an LCARS implementation, which will be instantly recognizable by any Star Trek fan. This is an attempt to translate this into proper HTML at the same time.

How it functions
----------------

You should see all participating users immediately upon starting the site. If you want to be tracked as well, you should enter a name and click "Track Me!".

"Auto-start" will attempt to start tracking automatically, the next time you open the site. Otherwise, you will have to click the "Track Me!" button yourself.

"Store location" tells the server not to kill your position when you log off. You can always remove the location manually by detoggling the "Track Me!" button.
